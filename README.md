#   Free Code Camp Project - Twitch Streamers

This is another in a series of projects as part of the Free Code Camp Front End Development Certificate.

This project is designed to be a [jQuery front end for the Twitch API](https://www.freecodecamp.com/en/challenges/intermediate-front-end-development-projects/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) which displays a list of Twitch streaming channels and the streams associated with those channels.

The Official User Stories for this project are:

* User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

* User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

* User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

* User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).

My User Stories are more technical in nature:

* User Story: I will see all application information in a responsive way on a laptop, high res display, iPhone, iPad and Galaxy S5.

* User Story: The page weight inclusive of JS, CSS, images, fonts will be less than 500kb. (Kicked ass on this one - total average page weight is 394kb!)
